# GitHub Telemetry Profile Analyzer

This system parses raw metadata from the GitHub API and runs it through a dual-layer evaluation pipeline: a deterministic mathematical execution layer for quantitative metrics and a probabilistic multi-agent semantic layer for qualitative career architecture insights.

## Technical Metric Formulations

The quantitative engine evaluates a profile across five specific domains, mapping historical Git activity to normalized percentages.

### 1. Consistency Score

The Consistency Score measures the regularity and distribution of code contributions over a trailing 12-month timeline, penalizing erratic development bursts and long periods of inactivity.

Let $M$ be the set of months in the evaluation period ($|M| = 12$). Let $c_m$ represent the count of contributions in a given month $m \in M$. The mean contribution volume $\mu$ is defined as:

$$\mu = \frac{1}{|M|} \sum_{m \in M} c_m$$

The variance $\sigma^2$ across the timeline is defined as:

$$\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{|M|} \sum_{m \in M} (c_m - \mu)^2$$

To bound the score between 0% and 100% while handling low contribution baselines, a coefficient of variation penalty is calculated with an epsilon factor $\epsilon = 1$:

$$S_{consistency} = \max\left(0, 100 \times \left(1 - \frac{\sigma}{\mu + \epsilon}\right)\right)$$

### 2. Community and Collaboration Score

This metric measures structural integration within collaborative and multi-contributor engineering environments, contrasting standalone repositories with collaborative project trees.

Let $R_o$ be the set of original, non-forked repositories owned by the target user. For each repository $i \in R_o$, let $u_i$ be the user's personal commit count, and let $T_i$ be the total aggregated commits from all contributors. The user's contribution ratio $r_i$ for that repository is:

$$r_i = \frac{u_i}{T_i}$$

The community score weighs repositories by their collaboration complexity. Repositories where the user co-authors with a wide distribution of external contributors yield a higher team coefficient, while single-author setups converge toward a baseline contribution offset:

$$S_{community} = \frac{1}{|R_o|} \sum_{i \in R_o} \left( (1 - |r_i - 0.5|) \times 100 \right)$$

### 3. Technology Stack Depth Score

The Technology Stack Depth metric measures technical scope and structural specialization. It evaluates language diversity alongside language usage volume.

Let $L$ be the set of distinct programming languages detected across original repositories. Let $v_l$ represent the frequency of language $l \in L$ across the project catalog. The breadth component balances out the raw volume via logarithmic dampening:

$$S_{technology} = \min\left(100, \left( \alpha \cdot |L| + \beta \cdot \sum_{l \in L} \log(v_l + 1) \right)\right)$$

Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are control constants calibrated to prevent saturation from superficial single-file repository additions.

### 4. Management and Documentation Score

This index assesses project maintainability and software engineering standards by verifying structural documentation baselines.

Let $N_{original}$ represent the total number of original, non-forked repositories. Let $N_{readme}$ represent the subset of those repositories containing a functional, non-empty root `README.md` file. The documentation index is a linear ratio:

$$S_{management} = \left( \frac{N_{readme}}{N_{original}} \right) \times 100$$

### 5. Advanced Contributions Score

This metric evaluates open-source engagement and community footprint by measuring contributions to external codebases.

Let $F$ be the set of upstream public repositories forked by the user. For each repository $j \in F$, let $S_j$ be the upstream star count, $K_j$ be the upstream fork count, and $u_j$ be the number of commits the user pushed to their local fork. The advanced score scales non-linearly with the popularity and weight of the target upstream project:

$$S_{advanced} = \min\left(100, \gamma \cdot \sum_{j \in F} \left( u_j \cdot \log(S_j + K_j + 1) \right)\right)$$

Where $\gamma$ acts as an optimization scaling constant.

### 6. Final Consolidated Agent Score

The total profile score is derived using a static dot-product of the metric score vector and a pre-configured weight vector $W$:

$$S_{final} = w_{con}S_{consistency} + w_{com}S_{community} + w_{tech}S_{technology} + w_{man}S_{management} + w_{adv}S_{advanced}$$

Subject to the structural constraint:

$$\sum w_k = 1.0$$

## Qualitative Agent Architecture

Quantifiable metrics do not capture non-numeric data like domain alignment, code intent, architectural patterns, and career trajectories. The application routes the processed data payload through an autonomous multi-agent pipeline orchestrated with LangGraph.

### Orchestration Graph Strategy

```
  [START]
     │
     ▼
┌──────────────┐
│Profiling Node│
└──────┬───────┘

```

The system packages the telemetry arrays into an isolated context object and passes it to an evaluation node configured with a strict, non-heuristic system prompt.

### Agent System Prompt Specification

```text
You are an elite Technical Career Architect and Senior Code Auditor.
Your task is to ingest a candidate's structured GitHub analytics payload and produce a highly accurate, strategic developer profile.

Strict Evaluation Directives:
1. Identify 'primary_techstack': Intersect high-frequency languages with the tooling in recent projects.
2. Infer 'job-role': Analyze velocity and architectures to deduce focus (e.g., AI/ML, Full-Stack, IoT).
3. Provide Actionable Score Optimization: Give 2-3 specific recommendations based on sub-optimal metrics.

CRITICAL - METRIC DEFINITIONS:
You MUST base your advice strictly on what these metrics actually measure mathematically. Do not invent meanings:
- 'Consistency': Measures the frequency and spread of commits across the last 12 months.
- 'Community': Measures collaboration, specifically the user's commit ratio on multi-contributor repositories.
- 'Technology': Measures the breadth (number of languages) and depth (frequency of use) of the tech stack.
- 'Management': Measures documentation habits, specifically the ratio of repositories with README files.
- 'Advanced': STRICTLY measures open-source engagement. It evaluates the stars/forks of upstream repositories the user has forked AND pushed commits to. It does NOT mean advanced coding techniques.

Formatting Output:
Deliver response in clean Markdown with clear headings. Sections: Executive Summary, Core Technical Profiling, Score Diagnostics Breakdown, Next-Action Roadmap.

## Profile Calculation Case Study: akshat-gupta-111

This section demonstrates the execution of the mathematical engine using an audited student developer profile payload as an empirical baseline.

### Telemetry Profile Input Summary

| Metric Dimension | Measured Percentage Score | Assigned Operational Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Consistency Score | 93.31% | 0.20 |
| Community/Collab Score | 62.00% | 0.30 |
| Tech Stack Depth Score | 95.00% | 0.25 |
| Management/Docs Score | 68.00% | 0.15 |
| Advanced Contributions Score | 85.54% | 0.10 |

### Step-by-Step Weighted Ingestion

To resolve the final score, the execution layer processes the elements through the dot-product formulation:

1. **Consistency Component Calculation:**

$$0.20 \times 93.31 = 18.662$$


2. **Community Component Calculation:**

$$0.30 \times 62.00 = 18.600$$


3. **Technology Component Calculation:**

$$0.25 \times 95.00 = 23.750$$


4. **Management Component Calculation:**

$$0.15 \times 68.00 = 10.200$$


5. **Advanced Component Calculation:**

$$0.10 \times 85.54 = 8.554$$



### Summation and Normalization

Combining the calculated components yields the consolidated value:

$$S_{final} = 18.662 + 18.600 + 23.750 + 10.200 + 8.554$$

$$S_{final} = 79.766$$
